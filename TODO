* Across-unit signalling
* Get very close to enemy bots (Lumberjacks only)
* Collatoral damage - target enemy trees, etc.
* Introduce Scout unit
* Introduce Tank unit
* Re-enable Lumberjack
* All other TODOs
* Gardeners to avoid planting trees in congested areas
* Move gardeners away from other gardeners
* Make sure Lumberjack attacks enemy trees first
* Make sure Lumberjacks stay a safe distance away from other friendly units/trees (when at war)
* Better Tank strategy (too slow to evade bullets)
